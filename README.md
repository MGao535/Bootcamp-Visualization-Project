# Spotify World Map

###Spotify compiles a playlist of the songs streamed most often over the course of that year. Each country's playlist (Country Top 50) includes 50 songs. The question is: What do these top songs have in common? Why do people like them?

###The audio features for each song were extracted using the Spotify Web API and the Spotipy Python library. Credit goes to Spotify for calculating the audio feature values.

##Exploring the Data:
###We looked for patterns in the audio features of the songs. Why do people stream these songs the most? We showed the two elements that generally contributed the most to the number 1 song being the most popular. We display graphs of these two elements showing the values for each of the number 1 song for each country.
